	* scene.c: Made light_pos be added to each vertex in the v array
	  after the vertices are multiplied by M_INFINITY. This fixes some
	  rendering issues. Thanks to Tong for pointing this out.
	* main.c: Added stdlib.h include to get rid of implicit declaration
	  warning in gcc for the exit function.
